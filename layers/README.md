# Layers 

In this folder, place the Layers in their own separate folders, and the variations for each specific layers inside those folders. 

If I had a collection of a character that had a Hat, Shoes, a Body and a Background, I would have a folder for each of those traits. 

Inside the folders, the variations must be individually animated in a video format, the videos must all have the same dimensions and duration.
